# Project Introduction

## Project Overview

**Torch-RecHub** is a flexible and easily extensible recommendation system framework built using PyTorch. It aims to simplify the research and application of recommendation algorithms, providing common model implementations, data processing tools, and evaluation metrics.

## Features

* **Modular Design:** Easy to add new models, datasets, and evaluation metrics.
* **Based on PyTorch:** Leverage PyTorch's dynamic graph and GPU acceleration capabilities.
* **Rich Model Library:** Includes various classic and cutting - edge recommendation algorithms (listed below).
* **Standardized Process:** Provide unified data loading, training, and evaluation processes.
* **Easy to Configure:** Easily adjust experimental settings through configuration files or command - line parameters.
* **Reproducibility:** Aims to ensure the reproducibility of experimental results.
* **Easy to Extend:** Decouple model training from model definition, without the concept of a base model.
* **Native Functions:** Use PyTorch's native classes and functions as much as possible without excessive customization.
* **Concise Model Code:** Facilitate beginners' learning while adhering to the ideas of academic papers.
* **Other Features:** For example, support negative sampling, multi - task learning, etc.

## Model Layer Design

### Model Classes
General Layers
Shallow Feature Modeling

* LR: Logistic Regression
* MLP: Multi - Layer Perceptron, parameters such as dims can be set through a dictionary.
* EmbeddingLayer: A general Embedding layer that handles three types of features, maintains an EmbeddingTable in dictionary format, and outputs the input embeddings required by the model.

Deep Feature Modeling

* FM, FFM, CIN
* self - attention, target - attention, transformer
