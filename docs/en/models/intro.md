# Model Library Overview

Torch-RecHub provides a rich recommendation model library that covers ranking, matching, multi-task learning, and generative recommendation. All models are implemented in PyTorch and are easy to use and extend.

## Model Library Structure

The model library is organized by recommendation stage and task type:

1. **Ranking Models**: Used during fine ranking to predict click-through rates or user preference scores for items
2. **Matching Models**: Used during candidate generation to retrieve candidates from a large item collection
3. **Multi-Task Models**: Jointly optimize multiple related tasks to improve generalization
4. **Generative Recommendation**: Uses generative models to produce personalized recommendations

## Model Selection Guide

### Choosing a Ranking Model

| Model | Suitable Scenario | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WideDeep | Basic ranking tasks | Combines linear and deep models to balance memorization and generalization |
| DeepFM | Scenarios where feature interactions matter | Captures both low-order and high-order feature interactions |
| DCN/DCNv2 | Explicit feature-crossing scenarios | Explicitly learns high-order feature crosses with high computational efficiency |
| DIN | Scenarios with dynamically changing user interests | Uses attention to capture user interests |
| DIEN | Long-sequence interest modeling | Models the dynamic evolution of user interests |
| BST | Scenarios where sequence features matter | Uses a Transformer to model sequence features |
| AutoInt | Automatic feature-interaction learning | Automatically learns feature-interaction patterns |

### Choosing a Matching Model

| Model | Suitable Scenario | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSSM | Text-matching scenarios | Uses a two-tower architecture to map users and items into the same vector space |
| YoutubeDNN | Large-scale recommendation | Deep matching based on user behavior sequences |
| MIND | Multi-interest recommendation | Learns multiple interest representations for each user |
| GRU4Rec/SASRec | Sequential recommendation | Models a user's recent behavior sequence |
| ComirecDR/ComirecSA | Controllable multi-interest recommendation | Allows control over the number of generated interests |

### Choosing a Multi-Task Model

| Model | Suitable Scenario | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SharedBottom | Scenarios with strongly related tasks | All tasks share the bottom network |
| MMOE | Scenarios with substantial task conflict | Uses a multi-gate mixture of experts so each task learns a different expert combination |
| PLE | Complex multi-task scenarios | Uses progressive layered extraction to alleviate negative transfer |
| ESMM | Scenarios with sample-selection bias | Uses entire-space modeling to address sample-selection bias |
| AITM | Scenarios with dependencies between tasks | Uses adaptive information transfer to learn task dependencies |

### Choosing a Generative Recommendation Model

| Model | Suitable Scenario | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HSTU | Next-item sequential recommendation | Hierarchical sequential transduction units with positional and temporal biases |
| HLLM | Sequential recommendation with precomputed LLM item embeddings | Freezes the item semantic table and trains a user-sequence Transformer |
| RQ-VAE | Item semantic-ID quantization | Compresses continuous item embeddings into multi-level codebook IDs |
| TIGER | Semantic-ID generative retrieval | Uses T5 to generate a valid semantic ID for the next item |

## Usage Example

```python
# Ranking-model example
from torch_rechub.models.ranking import DeepFM
from torch_rechub.trainers import CTRTrainer

# Create the model
model = DeepFM(deep_features=deep_features, fm_features=fm_features, mlp_params={"dims": [256, 128], "dropout": 0.2})

# Create the trainer
trainer = CTRTrainer(model, optimizer_params={"lr": 0.001}, device="cpu")

# Train the model
trainer.fit(train_dataloader, val_dataloader)

# Matching-model example
from torch_rechub.models.matching import DSSM
from torch_rechub.trainers import MatchTrainer

# Create the model
model = DSSM(user_features=user_features, item_features=item_features, temperature=1.0,
             user_params={"dims": [256, 128, 64]}, item_params={"dims": [256, 128, 64]})

# Create the trainer
trainer = MatchTrainer(model, mode=0, device="cpu")

# Train the model
trainer.fit(train_dataloader)
```
